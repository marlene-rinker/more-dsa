Write a function that takes a string and returns the first non-repeated character.

Character could be number, letter, or special character.

Could be a mixture of uppercase and lower case.

Could be an empty string - return null or return null if no non-repeated characters.

Examples:

'test' = 'e'

'tttt' = null

'Test' = 'T'
