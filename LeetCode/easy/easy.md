## Easy Questions from LeetCode

### Longest Common Prefix

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 

**Example 1:**

  **Input:** strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]

  **Output:** "fl"

**Example 2:**

  **Input:** strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]

  **Output:** ""

  Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 

**Constraints:**

  0 <= strs.length <= 200

  0 <= strs[i].length <= 200

  strs[i] consists of only lower-case English letters.
  

### Two Sum

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

### Reverse Integer

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Example 1:

  Input: 123

  Output: 321

Example 2:

  Input: -123

  Output: -321

Example 3:

  Input: 120

  Output: 21
